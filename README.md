# ESP01-Breakout-Board
ESP01 is a module that comes along with ESP8266 and an SPI flash memory but its not breadboard friendly. So in order to program and use it in, we use a breakout development board. This is a simple breakout board that gives the capabilities to program it and use its code simultaneously without much changes.
